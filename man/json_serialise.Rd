\usage{
json_serialise(x, schema)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object to be serialised}

\item{schema}{A schema (string or path to a string, suitable to be
passed through to \link{json_validator} or a validator
object itself.}
}
\value{
A string, representing \code{x} in JSON format
}
\description{
Safe serialisation of json with unboxing guided by the schema.
}
\details{
When using \link[jsonlite:fromJSON]{jsonlite::toJSON} we are forced to deal with the
differences between R's types and those available in JSON. In
particular:
\itemize{
\item R has no scalar types so it is not clear if \code{1} should be
serialised as a number or a vector of length 1; jsonlite
provides support for "automatically unboxing" such values
(assuming that length-1 vectors are scalars) or never unboxing
them unless asked to using \link[jsonlite:unbox]{jsonlite::unbox}
\item JSON has no date/time values and there are many possible string
representations.
\item JSON has no \link{data.frame} or \link{matrix} type and there are several
ways of representing these in JSON, all equally valid (e.g., row-wise,
column-wise or as an array of objects).
\item The handling of \code{NULL} and missing values (\code{NA}, \code{NaN}) are different
\item We need to chose the number of digits to write numbers out at,
balancing precision and storage.
}

These issues are somewhat lessened when we have a schema because
we know what our target type looks like.  This function attempts
to use the schema to guide serialsation of json safely.  Currently
it only supports detecting the appropriate treatment of length-1
vectors, but we will expand functionality over time.

For a user, this function provides an argument-free replacement
for \code{jsonlite::toJSON}, accepting an R object and returning a
string with the JSON representation of the object. Internally the
algorithm is:
\enumerate{
\item serialise the object with \link[jsonlite:fromJSON]{jsonlite::toJSON}, with
\code{auto_unbox = FALSE} so that length-1 vectors are serialised as a
length-1 arrays.
\item operating entirely within JavaScript, deserialise the object
with \code{JSON.parse}, traverse the object and its schema
simultaneously looking for length-1 arrays where the schema
says there should be scalar value and unboxing these, and
re-serialise with \code{JSON.stringify}
}

There are several limitations to our current approach, and not all
unboxable values will be found - at the moment we know that
schemas contained within a \code{oneOf} block (or similar) will not be
recursed into.
